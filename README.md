this is a java script project from The Odin Project it will initially have no GUI but later I will add one

for now this game will be only played in the GUI will be added later when I learn how to manipulate DOM with JS 

so the pseudo code i have in my mind is something like this 

1 write a function that will generate a number between 1 and 3 ✓

2 according to which number was generated change it to a string ✓

3 take a input from the player ✓

4 change the input to lower case to make the input case insensetive ✓

5 check if the player input is a valid input if not tell the player to give a valid input ✓

6 write a new function of the actual game that would take two perameters ( the user input , and the computer random generated input)

7 write a bunch of conditional statements that check which input the user choose and which input the computer choosed and according to them return a point to either the player or the bot and if both are euqal then return a draw 

8 write a function that would keep track of computer points and player points by taking the game function in a for loop that goes 5 times and increment on either player points or computer points

9 write a simple conditional that checks weather playerPoints are more or less then computerPoints and write a console that also takes userPoints and playerPoints in it to write how much playerPoints and how much are computerPoints and if both are equal write that its a draw

10 run the game function :D and everything should work   " should :D "   I hope
